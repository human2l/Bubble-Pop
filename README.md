# Bubble-Pop

* I made a lot of efforts into this project, added plenty of fancy feature which is beyond assignment requirements.
* You can download the code, build it on your own ios device, and play!
* I added a cheat mode, see if you can find out how to enable it!
* I might update more details about this project in the future.

For now, I am focusing on Angular + Spring. Check repository human2l/lms-new to see whatever you want :)
